# Guiding Principles For Engineering Documentation Standards
* **Keep documentation close to the code**

Software evolve, so does the documentation.

Keeping the code and the documentation at the same place does not ensure the doc will be updated, but it does help:
  - remove one excuse
  - limit the cognitive load
  - use code review to check that the needed doc is updated accordingly

* **Readme**
  
At the root of each repository there should be a meaningful ReadMe.md file.

Meaningful implies the following documentation:
  - description of the repository
  - document how to build and run tests
  - link to design documentation (can be external or other md files in the same repository)

* **Generate Documentation when possible**
  
The building blocks of the documentation should be part of the code:
  - code structure should make sense
  - classes, methods, functions should have proper documentation
  - pipeline steps should be documented in code

The process should leverage automation to generate documentation directly from the code, with no manual intervention required.

The documentation should be part of the “build artifacts” generated by our CI/CD.

* **Publishing documentation**
  
Most of the documentation should be directly available and not gated.

There are a few reasons for that:
  - allow developers to find our stuff
  - allow LLM to be trained on our doc and API so they can generate code and tutorial on it
  - People are more careful about doing good documentation when it is public
