# Documentation Standards For Code Comments

In .NET 8, the documentation standards for code comments, especially for classes and methods, are based on XML documentation comments. These comments serve as a standardized way to document code for better maintainability, usability, and integration with tools like Visual Studio or other IDEs.

* **Class-level Documentation**
At the class level, document the purpose of the class and its key features.

  - **Standards:**
    - **Purpose:** Describe the primary role of the class and its responsibilities.
    - **Dependencies:** List important dependencies or relationships to other classes, components, or systems.

* **Method/Function-level Documentation**
Each method should have documentation explaining what it does, its parameters, and its return value. If applicable, include exceptions that the method can throw.

  - **Standards:**
    - **Purpose:** What is the method doing? Why does it exist?
    - Parameters: A brief description of each input parameter, including the type and expected values or range (if applicable).
    - Return Value: Describe what the method returns, its type, and possible return values.
    - Exceptions: Mention any exceptions the method may raise and under what conditions.

Here is a guide on how to properly document classes and methods with XML documentation comments in .NET 8:

## General XML Documentation Comments Structure
XML comments use the following syntax:
```
/// <summary>
/// Brief description of what the class, method, or property does.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Additional detailed information about the class, method, or property.
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="paramName">Description of the parameter.</param>
/// <returns>Explanation of the return value.</returns>
/// <exception cref="ExceptionType">Condition that causes the exception.</exception>
```
* summary: A concise description of the element (class, method, property).
* remarks: Detailed information or additional notes about the element.
* param: Describes the parameters for methods or constructors. You should document each parameter individually by name.
* returns: Describes what the method returns.
* exception: Explains the exceptions the method might throw.

### Class Documentation Example
A class is documented by explaining its purpose, any important details, and how it interacts with other components.
```
/// <summary>
/// Represents a customer in the system.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This class contains properties and methods for managing customer data, 
/// including their personal details and order history.
/// </remarks>
public class Customer
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the customer's unique identifier.
    /// </summary>
    public int CustomerId { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the name of the customer.
    /// </summary>
    public string Name { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Calculates the total amount spent by the customer.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>
    /// The total amount spent by the customer.
    /// </returns>
    public decimal GetTotalSpent()
    {
        // Logic to calculate total spent
        return 100.50m;
    }
}
```
### Method Documentation Example
Methods should be documented to explain their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions they may throw.
```
/// <summary>
/// Adds a new order for the customer.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="order">The order to add.</param>
/// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException">Thrown when the order is null.</exception>
/// <exception cref="InvalidOperationException">Thrown when the customer is not eligible to place an order.</exception>
public void AddOrder(Order order)
{
    if (order == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(order), "Order cannot be null.");
    }

    // Logic for adding an order
}
```
### Property Documentation Example
Document properties with a short description of what they represent.
```
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the customer's email address.
/// </summary>
/// <value>
/// The email address of the customer.
/// </value>
public string Email { get; set; }
```
### Constructor Documentation Example
Constructors are documented similarly to methods but with an emphasis on explaining what the constructor is initializing.
```
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="Customer"/> class.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="customerId">The unique identifier for the customer.</param>
/// <param name="name">The name of the customer.</param>
public Customer(int customerId, string name)
{
    CustomerId = customerId;
    Name = name;
}
```
